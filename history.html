    <h2><strong>Historical Context</strong></h2>

    <p>
      Robertson hall, the building with columns in front of you, used to be the home of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. It is now home to the School of Public and International Affairs.
      <br>
      <br>
      In the summer of 2020, when Black Lives Matter protests in the name of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and Rayshard Brooks swept the nation, Princeton’s Board of Trustees decided to rename the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and Wilson residential college. Student activists had been calling for the removal of Wilson’s name since 2015, but the Board declined.
      <br>
      <br>
      In a letter to the community, President Eisgruber declared: “Wilson’s segregationist policies make him an especially inappropriate namesake for a public policy school. When a university names a school of public policy for a political leader, it inevitably suggests that the honoree is a model for students who study at the school. This searing moment in American history has made clear that Wilson’s racism disqualifies him from that role. In a nation that continues to struggle with racism, this University and its school of public and international affairs must stand clearly and firmly for equality and justice. The School will now be known as ‘The Princeton School of Public and International Affairs.’”

    <p>
      Wilson’s positive contributions to the University served as a shield to critiques of his racist and harmful policies. As President of the United States, Wilson segregated the federal civil service, even though it had been integrated for decades. When he was the President of Princeton, Wilson denied that any Black student had graduated with a Master's degree from the University. Wilson attended Princeton when the first African American student attended lectures, a professor when the first Black student enrolled as a graduate student, and president when two Black students earned their Master’s degrees. Yet, in a 1907 debate over whether graduates students could be considered alumni, Wilson wrote “The whole temper and tradition of the place are such that no negro has ever applied for admission, and it seems extremely unlikely that the question will ever assume a practical form.”
      <br>
      <br>
      Below you will see the portraits of some of the first Black students to attend Princeton, whose existence and accomplishments Woodrow Wilson attempted to erase. And you will see an explanation of the sculpture that stands before you, entitled Double Sights.

    <p>
      In the fall of 2019, before the removal of Woodrow Wilson’s name, the University installed the sculpture that stands in front of you, Double Sights. Designed by MacArthur Fellow and Gish Prize Winner Walter Hood, this sculpture attempts to address the complex legacy of Woodrow Wilson. It stands as a permanent marker intended to “educate the campus community and others about the positive and negative dimensions of Wilson’s legacy,” according to the Wilson Legacy Review Committee.
      <br>
      <br>
      Hood hopes the sculpture serves as a place of protest, and a beacon of hope and strength. The columns are etched with quotations highlighting both positive and negative aspects of Wilson’s policies. One of the center panels includes images of scholars and activists, like W.E.B Du Bois, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, and David Lloyd George, who criticized Wilson’s views on race and gender. The other displays quotes about the harmful actions Wilson took related to their critiques.

    Despite what Walter Hood intended to convey with Double Sights, students and faculty members protested the installation. Citing institutional racism, they claimed the sculpture did not effectively expose the negative aspects of Wilson’s policies.

    <p>
      Irwin William Langston “Dominie” Roundtree, one of Princeton’s earliest Black students, earned a Master of Arts from Princeton in 1895. Further, he may have been born into slavery, making him the only known previously enslaved person to have attended Princeton. Roundtree enrolled as an undergraduate at Lincoln University, the United States’ first degree-granting historically Black university, in 1882. He studied at Princeton Theological Seminary from 1892 to 1894.
      <br>
      <br>
      In 1904, Woodrow Wilson insisted that “no negro has ever applied for admission.” Wilson was a professor while Roundtree attended Princeton.

    <p>
      Born in 1763, John Chavis was the first African American to graduate from a college or university in the United States. He was accepted into the College of New Jerseys’ Theological School, later renamed Princeton University, in 1792. Not much is known about his early life, apart from his service in the Revolutionary War. After being licensed as a Presbyterian minister in 1800, he established a popular school in Raleigh, North Carolina where he taught Black and white students in segregated classes.

  <p>
    Theodore S. Wright, Princeton Theological Seminary Class of 1828, was the first African American to complete a theology degree. He then became the pastor of the First Colored Presbyterian Church in New York City and was a founding member of the American Anti-Slavery Society.
    <br />
    <br />
    During a return visit to Princeton in 1836, he was physically assaulted by Thomas Ancrum, an undergraduate student, on account of his race. The president at the time, James Carnahan, attempted to dismiss the incident.
