      Robertson hall, the building with columns in front of you, used to be the home of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. It is now home to the School of Public and International Affairs.
      <br>
      <br>
      In the summer of 2020, when Black Lives Matter protests in the name of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and Rayshard Brooks swept the nation, Princeton’s Board of Trustees decided to rename the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and Wilson residential college. Student activists had been calling for the removal of Wilson’s name since 2015, but the Board declined.
      <br>
      <br>
      In a letter to the community, President Eisgruber declared: “When a university names a school of public policy for a political leader, it inevitably suggests that the honoree is a model for students who study at the school…In a nation that continues to struggle with racism, this University and its school of public and international affairs must stand clearly and firmly for equality and justice. The School will now be known as ‘The Princeton School of Public and International Affairs.’”

    <p>
      When he was the President of Princeton, Wilson denied that any Black student had graduated with a Master's degree from the University. Wilson attended Princeton when the first African American student attended lectures, a professor when the first Black student enrolled as a graduate student, and president when two Black students earned their Master’s degrees. Yet, in a 1907 debate over whether graduate students could be considered alumni, Wilson wrote “The whole temper and tradition of the place are such that no negro has ever applied for admission, and it seems extremely unlikely that the question will ever assume a practical form.”

      Below you will see an explanation of the sculpture that stands before you, entitled Double Sights. Then you will see the student protests leading up to the decision to remove Wilson’s name from the public policy school and residential college.

    <p>
      In the fall of 2019, before the removal of Woodrow Wilson’s name, the University installed the sculpture that stands in front of you, Double Sights. Designed by artist Walter Hood, it stands as a permanent marker intended to “educate the campus community and others about the positive and negative dimensions of Wilson’s legacy,” according to the Wilson Legacy Review Committee. Hood hopes the sculpture serves as a place of protest, and a beacon of hope and strength.
      <br>
      <br>
      The columns are etched with quotations highlighting both positive and negative aspects of Wilson’s policies. One of the center panels includes images of scholars and activists, like W.E.B Du Bois, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, and David Lloyd George, who criticized Wilson’s views on race and gender. The other displays quotes about the harmful actions Wilson took related to their critiques.

  <p>
    Despite what Walter Hood intended to convey with Double Sights, students and faculty members protested the installation. Students and faculty saw the installation as an effort to placate the demands of the Black Justice League, which called for the removal of Wilson’s name from campus racism. Citing institutional racism, they claimed the sculpture did not effectively expose the negative aspects of Wilson’s policies and that the school needed to take a more assertive stance.

    <p>
      In 2015, over 200 Princeton students led by the Black Justice League walked out of their 11:00 am class and into President Eisgruber’s office to demand “affinity housing and spaces for Black students, cultural competency training for faculty, an undergraduate distribution requirement dedicated to the history of marginalized peoples, and the removal of Woodrow Wilson Class of 1879’s name from the policy school and residential college.” The students sat in Eisgrubers office for 33 hours, until he agreed to a revised set of their demands.

    <p>
      It took five more years for the University to remove Wilson’s name from university grounds and ultimately came as a result of nationwide pressures for institutions to commit to anti-racist practices. When 2020 came, the University failed to assign proper credit to the members of the Black Justice League who dedicated much of their Princeton career to the name change.

    <p>
      Members of the Black Justice League worked tirelessly to expose the foundational racism of the University. In addition to the 33-hour walk-out and sit-in, students held conferences, and screenings, and distributed the above posters which highlight racist quotes from Woodrow Wilson.
