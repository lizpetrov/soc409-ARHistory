      In the 1750s, Nathaniel FitzRandolph donated 4.5 acres of land to the College of New Jersey, which includes the land on which you—and Nassau Hall, the building before you—stands. The gates before you are called the FitzRandolph Gates, named in his honor.
      <br>
      <br>
      Below you will learn more about FitzRandolph himself and about William Taylor, an African American vendor who worked at this very spot for decades in the early 1900s.

    <h2><strong>William Taylor</strong></h2>

    <p>
      In the early 20th century, William Taylor moved to Princeton to start his own business, leaving his life as a servant in Virginia. For 16 to 18 hours a day, Taylor worked his  “doggie wagon,” selling hot dogs and refreshments to students and passersby. He often set up shop in the place you are standing right now.

    </div>

    <p>
      Although the Princeton University Archives do not account for Taylor, he was beloved by the Princeton community. The 1930 Coca-Cola advertisement shown above references Taylor by his nickname and illustrates him working his cart, and selling Cokes to the passing students.

    <p>
      Nathaniel FitzRandolph was born into a family that owned thousands of acres of land in the Princeton Area. In addition to the 4.5 acres of land he later donated to the College of New Jersey, FitzRandolph owned a plantation. In 1765, he listed this plantation for sale, alongside a “Negro Slave,” shown in the New York Mercury advertisement above. Quite literally, Princeton was built by people who owned slaves.
