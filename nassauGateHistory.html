    This arch on the east side of East Pyne Hall was named in honor of James Collins Johnson in 2018. Johnson, born into slavery in Maryland, would become a beloved figure on Princeton’s campus. He worked on the campus for over 60 years as a janitor and later, a vendor who sold fruit and other snacks from a wheelbarrow. A few years after arriving in Princeton, he was arrested and tried on suspicion of being a fugitive slave, but was ultimately redeemed.

    <p>
      James Johnson was born enslaved on October 2, 1816 in Maryland. He was one of many slaves in the Wallis household, an extremely wealthy and prominent family. He spent much of his childhood playing with Severn Teackle Wallis, who was only a month older than him — Wallis would go on to become a lawyer and help prosecute his fugitive slave case against Johnson. According to Johnson’s accounts, he escaped in August, 1839, after his master gave him five dollars for an errand. His escape began by walking to Wilmington, Delaware, followed by a steamboat ride to Philadelphia, and finally a couple trains to Trenton and then Princeton.

    <h2><strong>Life at Princeton</strong></h2>

    <p>
      Johnson began his first few years at Princeton as a janitor, often working in harsh conditions. Still, he lived without incident until summer 1843, when a student revealed him to his former master. Luckily, his fugitive slave case was resolved when a woman named Theodosia Prevost paid about $500 for his freedom. After emancipation, Johnson was able to purchase land in Princeton, in 1851. He moved full time to selling fruit, candy, and other snacks to students from a wheelbarrow. His constant presence on campus led him to become somewhat of a college mascot.

  <h2><strong>Arrest and Trial</strong></h2>

  <p>
    Many accounts identify John Henry Thomas as the student who revealed Johnson’s whereabouts to his former master; others point to Joseph August Wickes Sr. Though Johnson mentioned someone named “Simon Weeks” as the culprit, there are no records of a man by that name having been enrolled as a student. Regardless, in the summer of 1843, Philip and Severn Teackle Wallis, who had previously owned Johnson, filed their case under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793. This case was apparently an event of local, and even national, importance. However, Johnson was relieved from having to go through trial when a woman named Theodosia Prevost paid around $500 to purchase his freedom. This amount may have been collected in part or in full by a group of students, and would be equivalent to over $10,000 today.

    <p>
      Johnson’s story from fugitive slave to a revered and vital part of Princeton’s campus and town resonated with people for 60 years and beyond. Black and white students and local residents alike were moved by his journey and life. He left an impression on many white students, with at least half a dozen going on to write about Johnson in fiction and nonfiction works, such as the poem above from November 20, 1890. He also inspired many of Princeton’s black residents with his persistence and entrepreneurship. He was buried in the Princeton Cemetery in 1902, and his gravestone reads “James Johnson. The students friend.”
