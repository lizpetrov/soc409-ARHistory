      This project is an exploratory use of augmented reality. It attempts to expose the racist foundations of Princeton and in turn, uplift the too-often overlooked stories of the Black individuals who worked as slaves, servants, support staff, research assistants, and attended the University as students during times of explicit racism and white supremacy.
      <br>
      <br>
      In our class, Critical Approaches to Human-Computer Interaction, we’ve learned about efforts to create technologies that help rather than harm. This project intends to reveal the historical and spatial legacies of racism, hold the University accountable for its actions, and provide opportunities for reflection through the celebration of Black History at Princeton. We have interviewed members of the Princeton & Slavery Project and Black students to ensure this experience embodies these intentions.
