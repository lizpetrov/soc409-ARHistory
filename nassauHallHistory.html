      <p>
        Nassau Hall is the oldest and most iconic building on Princeton University’s campus. For hundreds of years, students and staff have passed by this building. However, not all of these students and staff have been justly remembered as a part of Princeton’s history. While Princeton University Archives indicate that the first African American student to receive an A.B. was John Leroy Howard in 1947, Howard was not the first Black student to earn a degree from Princeton. There were a number of Black students, specifically graduate students, preceding Howard who earned advanced degrees in the 1800s. Further, there were many Black campus employees who played important roles at the University. Read on to hear some of their stories.

    <p>
      Born free in 1840, Alfred N. C. Scudder was a janitor of Clio Hall, and his frequent inclusion in students’ photo albums suggests that he played a significant role in campus life. He may also have served as an assistant to Professors Stephen Alexander, despite the fact that Alexander believed white Americans to be superior to both Native and African Americans. He also may have worked with Professor John Schanck, likely assisting with scientific experiments and classroom instruction.

      Daniel Wallace Culp was a student at Princeton Theological Seminary in the late 1870s. Though he was never an enrolled student at Princeton University, James McCosh allowed Culp to attend his psychology lectures at Princeton in 1876. This provoked some southern students to unenroll. The Princetonian reported on the incident, “five young gentlemen…recently left Princeton College rather than sit in the same room with a negro one hour a week…”.

    <p>
      Irwin William Langston “Dominie” Roundtree, one of Princeton’s earliest Black students, earned a Master of Arts from Princeton in 1895. Further, he may have been born into slavery, making him the only known previously enslaved person to have attended Princeton. Roundtree enrolled as an undergraduate at Lincoln University, the United States’ first degree-granting historically Black university, in 1882. He studied at Princeton Theological Seminary from 1892 to 1894. In 1904, Woodrow Wilson insisted that “no negro has ever applied for admission.” Wilson was a professor while Roundtree attended Princeton.
